															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement1-300x161.png"/><p>

															<p><strong>Step 2-</strong> Stand the WaterRower upright and disconnect the bungee as shown.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement-138x300.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 3-</strong> Lay the WaterRower down and slowly pull the handle so that the drive strap	unwinds from the clutch housing. Do this gently as pulling too fast will cause the Recoil Belt to wind up too much. If you can, hold the clutch while doing this. Remove the handle and drive strap from the clutch by unstrapping the Velcro.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Service-Instructions-Photo-300x155.png"/></p>

															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement18-300x209.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 7-</strong> Remove the Clutch Retaining Pin as shown. You will need a hammer and punch (Slender Bolt) for this procedure.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement19-300x133.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 8-</strong> Remove the clutch assembly as shown.<br>

															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement4-300x175.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 13-</strong> Replace the JCB Bolts and Tie Rods connecting the Top Deck to the Tank assembly as shown. Ensure that the Tie Rod cross dowel slots are aligned with the Tie Rod. You may utilize a screw driver to assist this.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Step-11-300x171.png"/></p>
															
															<p><strong>Handle replacement</strong>

															Step 14- Take the new handle assembly and pass the Velcro end over the large
															pulley in the Forward Riser as shown. (The Velcro should face the large pulley as it passes between the wire riser form and the pulley).<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement13-300x225.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 15-</strong> Pass the Drive Strap around the large pulley and underneath the Top Deck back towards the clutch housing. Pass the end of the Drive Strap inside (towards the center of the machine) the Drive Strap guide pulley (the upper of the two guide pulleys). Take the end of the Drive Strap and place the edge against the join in the mating Velcro on the clutch housing as shown.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement27-300x179.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 16-</strong> Check that the belt orientation is correct. Slowly rotate the clutch (in a clockwise direction, as viewed from above) to feed the Drive Strap onto the clutch housing as shown. Make sure that the Drive Strap feeds evenly onto the clutch. Wind the Drive Strap onto the clutch so that the handle reaches its full forward position, as shown.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement14-300x241.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 17-</strong> If your Recoil Belt is still attached to the Recoil Bush then go onto step 19. Otherwise it will be necessary to reconnect the recoil. If you feel unsure about the orientation of the recoil it may be best to go through this process anyhow.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement15-300x260.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 18-</strong> With the handle in the full forward position, it is important that the Recoil Belt	wraps around the Recoil Bush between one and two turns. Once this is so pass the Recoil Belt inside (towards the center of the machine) the Recoil Belt guide pulley (the lower of the two guide pulleys) and over the two pulleys in the Forward Riser. Pass the belt underneath the machine towards the bungee as shown.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement16-243x300.png"/></p>

															<p><strong>Step 19-</strong> Stand the WaterRower upright and connect the Recoil Belt to the bungee as	shown.<br>
															<img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement6-142x300.png"/></p>

															<p>Note: If the recoil belt buckle and D-ring have been removed it will be necessary to	refit them before Step 14 may be completed. Refer to the <a href="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/tank-assembly-recoil-belt-buckle-replacement/">Recoil Buckle Replacement</a>

															<p><img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement29-300x91.png"/></p>
															<p>
															<p><strong>Step 4- </strong>Replace the handle. Pass the strap of the handle assembly over the large pulley in the Forward Riser as shown. Ensure the strap does not have any twists in it.</p>
															<p><img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement30-300x215.png"/></p>
															<p>
															<p><strong>Step 5- </strong>Thread the end of the Drive Strap inside (towards the center of the machine) of the Drive Strap guide pulley (the upper of the two guide pulleys). Guide the end of the strap around the clutch and insert it into the slot in the clutch (the slot without the bolt hole). Giving yourself some slack to work with, wrap the strap around the clutch and insert the end of the strap into the slot with the hole for the bolt.
															Fasten the strap to the clutch with the small bolt using the 1/8&rdquo; Allen Key.</p>

															<p><strong>Handle Replacement</strong></p>
															<p><strong>Step 1-</strong> Take the new handle assembly and pass the Velcro end over the large pulley in the forward riser as shown. (The Velcro should face the large pulley as it passes between the wire riser form and the pulley).</p>
															<p><img src="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Step-2-Top-Deck-Replacement13-300x225.png"/></p>
															<p><strong>Step 2- </strong>Pass the drive strap around the large pulley and underneath the top deck back towards the clutch housing. Pass the end of the drive strap inside (towards the center of the machine) the drive strap guide pulley (the upper of the two guide pulleys). Take the end of the drive strap and place the edge against the join in the mating Velcro on the clutch housing as shown.</p>
															<p><strong>Step 3- </strong>Check that the belt orientation is correct. Slowly rotate the clutch (in a clockwise direction, as viewed from above) to feed the drive strap onto the clutch housing as shown. Make sure that the drive strap feeds evenly onto the clutch.
