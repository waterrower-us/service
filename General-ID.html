					<h1>General Identification</h1><br>
				</div>
				<p>The WaterRower design has evolved in four basic steps (Series I, II, III and the S4). These design changes make spare parts identification a little more difficult. Since 1993 WaterRower has had two manufacturing facilities, one in London, England servicing the European Market and one in Rhode Island, USA, servicing the American market. Some people will know where their rowing machine was made, however it is best to check. The easiest way to identify the country of origin of your WaterRower rowing machine is the tank level gauge sticker (on the side of the tank) or the serial number label.</p><br>
