				<p align="justify"><strong><a id="erratic" name="erratic"></a>Erratic stroke rate ratings</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Please check your rowing technique. There does seem to be a problem with the read out if someone, in the Recovery Position, doesn&#8217;t extend beyond the foot board. (If the stroke is short, the S/R rises rapidly) Explain that they should reach for the pulley, towards the front of the rower. This should give a more accurate read out.</li>

					<p><strong>S3 Monitor</strong></p>

				<ol>
					<li>Check that the tacho or tacho pulley is not hitting anything. If the tacho pauses it indicates the end of the stroke and will hence register a higher than expected stroke rate.</li>
					<li>Check the tacho pulley (plastic pulley above the clutch) is not loose, if it is out of position, use a little glue to secure it back into position.</li>

					<li>The S4 sensor is an optical sensor and on occasion if exposed to a lot of sunlight it can affect the readings on the S4 monitor. Try rowing in a shaded area to see if the readings are more accurate.</li>
					<li>Check for dust and broken teeth on the sensor disk</li>
				</ol>

					<li>Check the alignment of the sensor, it may have come out of position in the groove underneath the Top Deck and it needs to be gently put back into position. <a href="../pdfs/IR_sensor_replacement_28-1-11.pdf" target="_blank">See Sensor Replacement instructions</a>
					</li>
					<li>Check the connection of the sensor and monitor.</li>
					<li>Check the magnets in the sensor disk. If one is missing you will need to replace the magnet. Please contact your nearest WaterRower office for magnet replacements.</li>
				</ol>
				<h1>If the numbers are still erratic, try the following:</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>Using a can of compressed air, spray out the sensor disk and clean out the sensor. You may need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpJnZjGvefA&amp;feature=youtu.be">remove the Top Deck</a>to do this.
					</li>
					<li>Use a dryer sheet or anti-static spray to clean the sensor and sensor disk.</li>
					<li>If your WaterRower is exposed to direct sunlight when rowing, try to move into the shade, the S4 sensor is an optical sensor so any form of light may interfere with the readings.</li>
					<li>Check for loose wires in the wire harness between the monitor and sensor.</li>
					<li>Replace the 4 AA batteries, erratic numbers can result due to low battery power. See instructions <a href="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/pdfs/wrsc004_s4_monitor_battery_replacement.pdf">here</a>
					</li>
					<li>Check the sensor disk for misaligned teeth – see picture above.</li>
					<li>Replace the sensor and sensor disk. If your WaterRower is less than 3 years old, please complete the <a href="http://www.waterrowerservice.com/warranty-request-form/">Warranty Request Form</a> for replacement parts or call our service representatives at your <a href="http://www.waterrower.com/support/contactus.php">nearest WaterRower office</a>.

					<li>There could be a problem with the green Tacho Belt. Where the Tacho Belt is joined, there may be a lump, this could be causing the problem. It also could be the Tacho Clutch Pulley. There have been problems with nicks in the pulley, causing noises. Ask customer to inspect the area, proceed accordingly.</li>

					<p><strong>M1, Squeaky/lumpy seat, troubleshooting:</strong></p>
				</blockquote>
				<ol>
					<li>A note about how the seat is meant to work: The guide wheels on the bottom are not meant to stay in contact with the inner part of the rail extrusions (guides/runners). These wheels are there to make sure the seat stays on track, so one side or the other may roll against the side but both left and right wheels should not be against the rails at the same time. If they do there is a spacing issue. The M1 footboard is connected to the rails with bolts and two footboard spacers. We have seen these black plastic bushes been left out during assembly in the past. If these spacers are not between the tabs on the footboard and the rails, the footboard bolts pull the rails too close together in the center of the rail and the seat is pinchedÂ when it gets close to the footboard. If guide wheels on both sides touch rails, please confirm that the spacers are there. If the spacers are there, measure distance between the inside edge of rail extrusions. Correct spacing is 290mm (11.4Â). If this distance is correct along the length of the rail, an out of square seat is probably the issue. Note that guide wheels can come off of their bearings or disintegrate when forced against rail.</li>
					<li>If guide wheels are not rubbing and there is still a squeak: If the squeak happens in the same spot each time up the rail, then there probably is a problem with the rail extrusion, if problem moves, look to seat. An air patch under the extrusion would cause it to be pressed down by the seat and squeak. If the squeak happens when guide wheel hits inside of rail guide, check that the rubber of the guide wheel is still on the bearing. It may have lifted so it is pinching the lip of the rail guide.</li>
					<li>As to Lumpiness in seat: Check for something visible on extrusion surface or load wheels causing lumps. These parts should be kept clean. If lumps happen in the same spot each time up the rail, then there probably is a problem with the rail extrusion, if problem moves, look to seat. Rail extrusions are held on by double sided padded tape and are relatively easy to replace. Can lumps be identified to be on one side or the other? If so, rotate the seat and check if the lumps change sides. If lumps also change sides there may be a broken bearing in the load wheels of the seat. If lumps remain on original side, problem is probably with extrusion.</li>

					<li>A note about how the seat is meant to work: The guide wheels on the bottom are not meant to stay in contact with the inner part of the rail extrusions (guides/runners). These wheels are there to make sure the seat stays on track, so one side or the other may roll against the side but both left and right wheels should not be against the rails at the same time. If they do there is a spacing issue. If footboard or rear spacer is cut too small, the rails will be pulled too close together either at the rear or in the center of the rail. This causes the seat to be pinchedÂ when it gets close to the defective part. If guide wheels on both sides touch rails, please measure distance between the inside edge of rail extrusions. Correct spacing is 248mm (9.7). If this distance is correct along the length of the rail, an out of square seat is probably the issue. Note that guide wheels can come off of their bearings or disintegrate when forced against rail.</li>
