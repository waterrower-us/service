							<p>WaterRower S4 monitors are capable of online web racing and workout analysis with software such as <a href="http://www.webracing.org" target="_blank" title="Web Racing">NetAthlon</a>, **<a href="http://www.we-row.com" target="_blank" title="We-Row free rowing online racing simulator">We-Row</a>, and <a href="http://www.howtorow.com/software" target="_blank" title="WaterCoach - learn how to row fit software">WaterCoach Fit</a>. To enjoy this feature, you must connect your S4 to a computer with an interface cable. There are two types of interface cables: The newer mini USB to USB cable, which is now included with WaterRower S4 machine purchases (also available in our shop), or the Serial RS-232 cable, which is compatible with the S4 version 1 monitor and can be adapted to USB with a Serial to USB converter.</p>
							<p>The driver software below may be used if plug and play does not work initially for all S4 to PC connections. The S4 USB is plug and play on most versions of Mac OSX**. <strong>S4 version 2 monitor driver installation under Windows operating system is now possible via our one-click .exe file (<a href="../downloads/wrs4v2.exe" title="WaterRower Rowing Machine S4v2 driver download">Download file wrs4v2.exe</a>).</strong> If a manual installation is required, please review our step-by-step installation guide pdf document for a detailed explanation of the installation process.</p>
							<p><b>**We-Row is the only Mac compatible program; it is currently in Beta testing and open to the public. In order to use We-Row, you will need the newest version of the monitor. If you&#8217;d like to purchase this version, please see the following link:<br></b></p>
